# "Coder Profile" React Project
This project is a basic react website for sharing information related to ones coding experience. This is a toy site used
by COSC 631 to learn some react basics as a part of a few assignments in preparation to create a web store with react
with an off the shelf store API backend. 

The data included in this project is _for example only_ and is not true, or representative of any existing being that I 
am aware of.
